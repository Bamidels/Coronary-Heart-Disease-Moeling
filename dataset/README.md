Data Set Description
The dataset used in this project is from the Framingham Heart Study, an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle website and is used to predict the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients. The dataset consists of over 4,240 records and 15 attributes, including demographic variables such as age, gender, and education level, as well as clinical variables such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status. The dataset is provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) format and has missing values in some of the variables. The dataset has been pre-processed to remove duplicate records and outliers. A detailed description of the dataset variables can be found in the accompanying README file in the "dataset" folder of the GitHub repository.
